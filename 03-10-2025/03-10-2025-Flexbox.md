* ` Display flex property given to parent tag/ element so that it's effect visible in child elements`

```
div{
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;        aligns in X-axis    (screen left to right) row-wise
    align-items: center;            aligns in Y-axis    (screen bottom to top) column-wise
}
```
## justify-content properties

1. flex-start           (align-items also have same propertie)
2. center               (align-items also have same propertie)
3. flex-end             (align-items also have same propertie)
4. space-around
