# How Browsers Actually Talks To Servers Using HTTP & HTTPs & Make Web Secure

01. What is HTTP?

- Http Protocol are set of rules which is  pre-installed in every OS or device which uses internet.
- Http rules is a bridge between client and server to talk to each other and exchange data.

## HTTP Version
    1.0 - Slow  - Each request opens a new connection (Headers, status code, content type can be shared)

    1.1 - Fast  - Supports chunked transfer, caching, pipelining (Persistent connections (keep-alive))

    2.0 - Faster - Multiple requests on one connection (Binary protocol) Header compression, server push

    3.0 - Fastest - Uses QUIC (built on UDP, not TCP) Faster, more secure, better for mobile,  Reduced latency and connection times
