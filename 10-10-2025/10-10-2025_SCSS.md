## Features -

* Variables

## Variables

* to create variable use $ as first letter and then name it ex-     $bg-color

```
@mixin buttonStyle( $bg-color){
    padding: 20px 30px;

        h1{
            font-size: 1.2rem;
        }
    }
}
```

## Mixins

* Helps to prevent from same code repetition (reusable styles)

```

@mixin flexCenter(){

}

main{
    @include flexCenter();
}

* Use @import to use the components in main scss file
* keeps project dynamic modular and easy to maintain

* How to use
    * create a _fileName.scss
    * write a @mixin code for the component inside _fileName.scss
    * @import "fileName" in main.scss file
    * then call the @mixin with name inside selector where you want to use that component
