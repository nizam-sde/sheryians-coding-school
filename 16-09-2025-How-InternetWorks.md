> **Internet** - Internet is a global communication system that links together thousands of individual networks using the Internet protocol suite (TCP/IP) to communicate between

smartphone -> texted/videocall -> in the form of small packets our data transmit from device to air looking for the nearest tower -> Tower -> through the grounded cables of tower it reaches to the ISP -> ISP ->checks is it allowed /or restricted website , internet pack active or not, it will check whether the requested website is in the same origin coutry or outside, if same then it will be sent to the server location of the requested website then the data will be fetched and given back to the user but if not then it will sent to -> DNS -> dns work like phonebook for every domainName there IP address is stored so when we search the domainName the dns search from the saved list and provide the ip address registered against that domain once the ip address provided to the isp then isp visits to that ip address and then response from that ip adress captures and then it reverted back to the user with response



> smartphone (PACKETS) -> Towers (fiber cable) -> ISP -> DNS Server-> IP Address


## There are two best suitable Network connection
1. **Submarine Cable** (Ocean Sea - Fiber Optics Cabel)
2. **Satalite**

# Few surprising facts

* Laptop/Mobiles do not have Ip addresses of there own.
